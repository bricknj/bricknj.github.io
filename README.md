# bricknj.github.io
This is my personal website!

I built this using GitHub Pages.
While I have experience designing and maintaining drag-and-drop style Wix
websites and briefly experimented with Git, HTML, and CSS to support a friend's project, this was my first major attempt at really learning and implementing these skills.
