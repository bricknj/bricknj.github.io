        My capstone project dealt with the breakdown of cartilage and how 
        this results in arthritis and a change in material properties. 
        Unfortunately, the symptoms of arthritis only occur after the 
        cartilage is substantially degraded. Additionally, there is no 
        current means of quantitatively evaluate cartilage damage. Our 
        project was to develop a preliminary testing system which could 
        address these issues. It was meant to quantify the permeability 
        and shear modulus of cartilage samples via the plot of a 
        force-relaxation curve. This curve was generated by recording the 
        force over a period of time during an indentation test. This project 
        was actually a continuation off a previous capstone effort to develop 
        such a machine. Due to this, we inherited an electromechanical system, 
        but it had many issues requiring an overhaul with a strong emphasis on 
        control systems and electrical engineering.
