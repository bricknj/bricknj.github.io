                            I am a mechanical design engineer with significant experience across
                            robotics, consumer electronics, and medical product development.
                            Strengths include advanced SolidWorks, design of electromechanical
                            systems, and a drive to learn new skills, especially in electronics 
                            and controls.

                            Currently, I work as a mechanical engineer and business developer at 
                            NK Labs, a product development firm in Cambridge, MA. You can learn

                            I graduated from Northeastern University in 2017 with a Bachelor's 
                            degree in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Biomechanical Engineering.

                                I have engaged in many design projects at the very early, 
                                idea-on-a-napkin stage and led them through engineering drawing 
                                generation, to assembly and testing. Most projects were done in 
                                SolidWorks, though I also have experience in CREO and OnShape. I have 
                                been reponsible for concept ideation, material and finish selection, 
                                part sourcing, drawings, vendor contacts, etc.

                                I have developed prototypes of varying complexity: from specific

                                process, to highly-detailed, functional full systems. I have experience 
                                operating 3D printers, laser cutters, an OMAX water jet cutter, and have 
                                led engagement with many manufacturing vendors, both domestic and abroad

                                Starting from my 8+ years in the FIRST Robotics community, I have 
                                accrued substantial machining experience. That, coupled with the 
                                invaluable feedback I have received from machinists and more senior 
                                engineers over the years, has all fed into my DFM approach. Through 
                                them, I learned effective ways to optimize for machinability, reduce 
                                part cost, and streamline production timelines.

                                I had made a Wix website in college for sharing portfolio pieces. When 
                                I revisited it several years later, there were a lot of errors as the 
                                platform had changed while I was not maintaining the site. Facing this 
                                hurdle, naturally, the best course of action was to make a new website 
                                from scratch, without having previous experience in HTML and CSS.

                                My site is hosted on Github Pages, so this also gave me a reason to
                                practice using Git, which I have seldom needed in my mechanical 
                                career thus far. Though I use Windows daily, I took this opportunity 
                                to familiarize myself with navigating Linux. I ran everything on Ubuntu 
                                via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

                                I bought a new bike light, and it was great. Then, I bought 
                                a new bike, and it was also great. Putting the two together 
                                - not great. The mount that comes with the light could not 
                                fit on 31.8mm handlebars. I was devastated.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                So I designed this modular handlebar mount in Onshape. I 
                                printed the parts on a Markforged FDM printer for high-
                                strength, as these parts would see a lot of wear and tear on 
                                my bike. My light is now held securely, but it is still 
                                easily removable. The upper parts are also replaceable, so 
                                attachments for other lights or other items can be designed 
                                to work with the bar-clamping parts in the future. Here's to 
                                many well-lit rides!

                                I listen to a lot of music throughout the day, but, on the occasions
                                that I do take off my headphones, I needed a place to put them. My
                                office desk is frequently an active working environment, so I
                                designed this mount which could be bolted onto my workspace. I also
                                printed a mating part which hooks onto my cubicle wall. Both were 
                                printed on a Formlabs Form 2, as I wanted higher resolution on the
                                curves I had designed into the part than I might have gotten via FDM.

                                My partner and I chose to pursue this task as our final project for 
                                our Biomedical Optics course in Taipei, Taiwan. The purpose of this 
                                graduate-level research was to find a relationship between the 
                                concentration of blood in bone and its effect on detected power as 
                                light penetrated through our two-layer model of skin and bone. We 
                                used MATLAB and MCML modeling to simulate various conditions, 
                                including ranges of wavelengths, blood concentrations, and distances 
                                to detectors. Ultimately, we found that increasing blood concentration 
                                has a large effect on the increase in detected power.
